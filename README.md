# Hi!
I'm Justin, a backend software developer based in Seattle, Washington. I love designing end-to-end systems, exploring new programming languages, and experimenting with tools that make me a more effective engineer.

Most of the projects you’ll find on my GitHub are free to use — feel free to explore and adapt them! I especially enjoy creating simple command-line utilities that streamline development workflows, reduce repetitive tasks, and make coding just a little more efficient.
